Where is the worst Place in NYC to have a heart Attack?

Our program uses OpenStreetMap geography data and Dijkstra's algorithm
to calculate the distance from a set of source nodes in a graph. Our
motivating question was to determine what areas of a city are underserved
by some service, such as a fire department or emergency room.

To run our program run

python3 Main.py [OSM input file name] [output csv file name] csv

Then, when prompted enter the names of source intersections.

For example:

python3 Main.py lower-manhattan.osm.xml lower-manhattan.csv csv

Then, when prompted (these are the hospital locations we used):

East 99th Street
2nd Avenue
end intersection
Pelham Parkway South
Bronx and Pelham Parkway
end intersection
Park Avenue
East 146th Street
end intersection
East 210th Street
Kossuth Avenue
end intersection
Shore Parkway
East 6th Street
end intersection
Clarkson Avenue
East 37th Street
end intersection
Park Avenue
Throop Avenue
end intersection
Baxter Avenue               
41st Avenue
end intersection
161st Street
82nd Drive
end intersection
1st Avenue
East 26th Street
end intersection
5th Avenue
West 136th Street
end intersection
